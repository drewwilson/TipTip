Version 1.3   -   Updated: Mar. 23, 2010

This Plug-In will create a custom tooltip to replace the default
browser tooltip. It is extremely lightweight and very smart in
that it detects the edges of the browser window and will make sure
the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a result the
tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to the left
or to the right depending on what is necessary to stay within the
browser window. It is completely customizable as well via CSS.
